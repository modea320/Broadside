This was especially a challenge without a game engine, done in a semester. The group still managed to hard code path systems, artificial intelligence, and smooth animation and overall gameplay. \r\n### Authors and Contributors (GitHub usernames)\r\n@modea320 @alexwhiteside1 @glogan dinkovs mlogalbo\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
