<p>An Android Mobile Game</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>This is the page created by Matthew O'Dea to showcase the Broadside applicaiton. 
It was developed in Fall 2013 for the course Software Engineering. 
The game's theme was a battleship style defense game that included pirate ships, viking ships, enemy planes, and guided missiles.
The user also had to use his crew to defend and repair the ship as the fight went on, and we also implemented an upgrade screen to purchase new weaponry.

<p>All graphics were original, and created by Matt O'Dea using Adobe Illustrator.</p>

<a name="coding" class="anchor" href="#coding"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Coding</h3>

<p>Coding was done using the Eclipse IDE and using a GitHub repository. We used an MVC architecture on the android platform.
It was an especially challenging project because everything from the enemy path systems to the animations was hard coded in raw Java in a semester, with no game engine involved.
